<h1>RULE #1:</h1>
<h2>TREAT OTHERS THE WAY YOU WISH TO BE TREATED
The good old Golden Rule says it all:
empathy, tolerance and peace. This
principle teaches you to love yourself
and love others. It spans cultures and
faiths and is a universal age old
concept which can’t fail!<br><br>

Past simple: He treated others the way he wished to be treated. <br>

Present perfect: She has treated others the way she wishes to be treated. <br></h2>

<div class="ImgIng3-1"></div><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>


<h1>RULE #2:</h1>
<h2>LISTEN TO HEAR WHAT OTHERS HAVE TO SAY,
NOT TO SPEAK
Engage in dialogue with an open mind and the real will to listen to
others. Only then will you be able to understand each other and
build bridges. Change cannot happen and peace cannot be
established if people are unable to communicate with others; to
listen to their experiences and views and show empathy,
understanding and compassion. <br><br>

Past simple: He listened to hear what others had to say, not to speak. <br>

Present perfect: She has listened to hear what others have to say, not to speak. <br></h2>

<div class="ImgIng3-2"></div><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>


<h1>RULE #3:</h1>
<h2>ACCEPT DIFFERENCE OF OPINION
We all have different opinions and we may not all
agree on the same things. Building compromise and
mutual understanding is incredibly important.
Sometimes we simply need to agree to disagree and
recognise that there are different beliefs and forms of
expression other than our own. <br><br>

Past simple: He accepted the difference of opinion and moved forward with mutual understanding. <br>

Present perfect: She has accepted the difference of opinion and recognized other perspectives. <br></h2>

<div class="ImgIng3-3"></div><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<h1>RULE #4:</h1>
<h2>DO NOT FIGHT VIOLENCE WITH
VIOLENCE 
Violence is never the answer. Peace can only be
brought through free will, dialogue, empathy and
forgiveness. Do not stoop to same level as someone
who is violent and therefore continue the vicious
cycle. This does not change anything. <br><br>

Past simple: He did not fight violence with violence, and instead chose dialogue and understanding. <br>

Present perfect: She has not fought violence with violence, seeking peace through empathy and forgiveness instead. <br></h2>

<div class="ImgIng3-4"></div><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<h1>RULE #5:</h1>
<h2> ACCEPT THAT IDENTITY IS FLUID 
Any one person can have multiple aspects to their identity. Identity
comprises many elements such as nationality, cultural-linguistic
origin, age and religious beliefs. Identity can and does change,
taking on many new forms and means of personal expression as we
learn new languages, move home, adopt new beliefs, marry into a
different tradition and experience life! Do not put people into a box.
Avoid categorising people according to and us vs.
them narrative and remember: we are all singular individuals with
unique experiences. Such approaches and narratives are highly
divisive and unproductive. <br><br>

Past simple: He accepted that identity was fluid and embraced the changes in his own life. <br>

Present perfect: She has accepted that identity is fluid and has grown through new experiences and beliefs. <br></h2>

<div class="ImgIng3-5"></div><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<h1>RULE #6:</h1>
 <h2>AVOID STEREOTYPES 
Take people for the individuals they
are. Avoid misconceptions,
stereotypes and toxic narratives and
get to know a person instead. This
will avoid offence,
misunderstandings and ultimately
help you to create a real bond with
others based on true understanding,
empathy and trust. After all, no one
likes to be judged – especially from
the outside. <br><br>

Past simple: He avoided stereotypes and got to know people for who they truly were. <br>

Present perfect: She has avoided stereotypes and built deeper connections through empathy and understanding. <br> </h2>
